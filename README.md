## HTML Review
### 1. View hello.html in a web browser:
Open the 'hello.html' file using a Chrome, the page should be empty.

### 2. Make your page stand out!
To do that
1. Open hello.html using sublime text
2. Change it to be topic about you or a topic you like(hint hint: Bruno Mars), your page should have the following:
  * A header tag
  * Add/change title for your page
  * A body tag
  * A p paragraph inside you <body> tag
  * A h1 tag inside the <body> tag
  * A h2 tag inside <body> tag
 
Not sure what to do? See the html example [here](https://www.w3schools.com/)

### 3. Add an image.
In the same hello.html file, add an image of you or the animal or the topic you wrote about. Set the width to 400px.

### 4. Add a link.
Add a link to the Wikipedia page about the animal or the topic you're interested in.
